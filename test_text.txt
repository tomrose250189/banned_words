Opening Sequence

COUCH SCENE
      Everybody is a sea monkey (except for mermaid Maggie) and swims
      to a couch made of clams to look at a treasure chest instead of
      a TV.  The treasure chest opens to reveal diamonds.

Animation, Continuity, and other Goofs

- An animation glitch occurs when Apu grabs the tofu dog; for one
  frame, a part of his head is pushed downward.  {jl}

= One of Lisa's hair spikes was split in one shot but in the next shot
  looks normal again.  {jl}

+ Smithers was stung by a bee in 8F09 and suffered no ill effects.
  {vm}

= Dr. Riviera leaves the door open, but when he defends the charge of
  misuse of cadavers, the door is closed.  {jl}

= Chalmers should know how to get to Skinner's house.  (See 3F12.)

= Chalmers takes a burger but Skinner doesn't.  Even if Skinner did
  have one, there should be two burgers left on the platter.  But
  there's only one.  (And there's a lot less fries)  {jl}

* Springfield Volunteer Fire Department's initials are "SPFD".  {jl}

+ I thought the Springfield Shopper was free (not 25 cents), and I 
  thought it was delivered to OFF's house.  {jh}

= When Homer pulls Maggie's baggie off, he's grabbing it by the bottom,
  but when it comes off, he's suddenly holding it by the arms.  {ddg}

c Captions read "( thumping on glass )" for Maggie when she's not
  doing anything.

+ In the "Where's Daddy?" game it should have been Homer hiding behind
  a sheet (however, Lisa learned to do her own diapers [2F15]).

* If Krusty Burger is indeed much like McDonalds, why are their burgers
  grilled?  {jl}

+ Bumblebee Man has spoken English off camera before (and pretty well,
  I might add; see 1F11).  {jh}

* Spanish Bee man cannot be electrocuted by a single spaghetti strand
  because of no return path for the current.  {hl}

c When Pedro the Bee suffers his accidents at home, captions say the
  radio plays "La Cucaracha" when it is playing the Mexican Hat Dance.
  {jl}

* The Spanish is atrocious (see below).  {vm}

* When Snake knocks over the mailbox, letters appear to pour out of the
  ground as if from a geyser.  {ddg}

* Herman probably wouldn't be able to fire his double-barrel shotgun,
  which needs to be manually loaded.  {vm}

= Chief Wiggum loses his hat in the fight with Snake, but in the next
  chapter of the Herman story he has his hat back.  {jl}

* How did Milhouse get the mace and helmet w/visor in the bathroom?
  {vm}

= Herman's teeth aren't visible when he's knocked down by Milhouse,
  but in the next shot they are.  {jl}

* The barber pole in Snippy Longstockings isn't moving which normally
  means the shop is closed.  {jl}

+ The barber shop was called "Jake's Unisex Hair Palace" in previous 
  episodes, and Jake the barber sounds different (almost like Sideshow 
  Mel this time).  {jh}

* Why is Ralph further down the street than his parents?  (see FFF)
  {jh}

+ Jasper supposedly got a nose job but he's seen with his regular nose.
  {vm}

+ Although Frink says the monkeys stole his glasses, he is, in fact, 
  wearing them.  {rs}

Comments and other observations

Before there was Martha Stewart... {bjr}
...there was `Helpful Hints with Heloise,' or something like that.  As
    a women's columnist, Heloise offered simple, but counter-intuitive,
    hints on how to keep that house looking great.  This is probably
    who Marge is referring to when she says, `If I remember my
    Heloise.'

Son of Car Watch
Benjamin Robinson says, "Unless you've just arrived here from Mars, you
    know that the tall man at the end of the show drives a Volkswagen
    Beetle.  These two stories seem apropos:

     - VW had an ad showing Wilt Chamberlain [sic] trying -- and
       failing -- to get into a Beetle.  The headline:  `They said it
       couldn't be done.  It couldn't.'  The copy said, essentially,
       `Even though Wilt the Stilt won't fit, you probably will.'

     - One basketball star -- think it may have been Manute Bol --
       drove a Beetle before he made the big time.  To fit, he took out
       the driver's seat, and drove from the back seat!

    Snake, as usual, is driving one of his endless supply of 1969 Dodge
    Chargers.  He must get them from the same bottomless well that
    Maggie gets her pacifiers."

Theme Music
      "Skinner & The Superintendent"

	 Skinner, with his crazy explanations
	 The superintendent's gonna need his medication
	 When he hears Skinner's lame exaggerations
	 There'll be trouble in town tonight.

      "Cletus the Slack Jawed Yokel"

	 Some folk'll never eat a skunk
	 But then again some folk'll
	 Like Cletus
	 The slack jawed yokel.

	 Most folk'll never lose a toe
	 And then again some folk'll
	 Like Cletus
	 The slack jawed yokel.

      "The Tomfoolery of Professor John Frink"

	 N-hey, n-hey
	 Professor Frink, Professor Frink
	 He'll make you laugh, he'll make you think
	 He likes to run
	 And then the thing with the...
	 um, person...

How many short films, again?
Benjamin Robinson says, "I counted the stories (c'mon, you knew
    _someone_ was going to), and ended up with eighteen.  (That's
    counting the three parts of Lisa's bad hair day as three stories,
    and including Prof. Frink's abortive attempt at tale-spinning.)  So
    someone slipped up, right?  Maybe not.  In octal (base-8)
    numbering, 18 is 22.  People with four fingers per hand would most
    likely count in octal.  So the title could be a sly meta-reference!
    Or maybe someone just miscounted, after all."

I counted twenty-two, counting the outtaked "Marge the Hostage" and
    "Ralphplane!"   My counting included Dr. Nick's board review and
    Grampa's insanity as two stories.

Yet More Antiquated Burns Jokes
Haynes Lee gives the meanings of Burns' insults to Smithers, from the
    Oxford English Dictionary:

      - SHIRKADAY: "shirk" means to avoid work.
      - MEPHITIC: to emit a foul-smelling or poisonous stench.
      - FLANGE: a projecting flat rim, collar, or rib, used for
		strengthening or attachment.
      - DISCOMBOBULATED (from Grampa): U.S. jocular for disturbed,
				       disconcerted.

Maybe Tito Puente and Celia Cruz should have guest starred.
Veronica Marquez notes, "The Spanish in this episode is atrocious,
    sounding more like a translation of English dialogue into Spanish
    than real Spanish.  And worse, there's no such word as `wudpequero'
    in Spanish.  Of course it takes a fluent Spanish speaker like 
    myself to understand what I mean.

    "For the record, Pedro said: `Oh, what a terrible day at work.
    First, the attack of the crazy woodpecker.  Then, a disaster of
    electricity.  And finally, a catastrophe with a baseball.' Then,
    `Ah, time to relax in peace and quiet.  Ow, oranges on the head!
    Ow, a precarious chandelier.'  Then the woman says `Look at the
    terrible thing I don't understand how this know how I can live
    with a man so irresponsible.  No, no no no no!'  (Hey, don't ask
    me what that should mean.)  Then, Pedro says (the only acceptable
    Spanish here) `Oh, where's my tequila?'  And most legal statements
    in the United States are done in English regardless of the language
    spoken.  You'd find better Spanish on bilingual applications."

    I think the awful Spanish made it funnier, but that's just me.

Moe the Speakeasy
Mark Richey notes that Moe was a former speakeasy.  Speakeasies are
    bars that sold alcohol illegally during the prohibition.  If a
    raid happened, the owners of the speakeasy would slip into an
    alcove behind bulletproof glass and lock themselves in to avoid
    getting shot or arrested.  Keep in mind that Moe is apparently
    pretty old since he was one of the original Little Rascals.

Name that episode!
Benjamin Robinson notes, "This is one of only four episodes broadcast
    with its title.  So you don't go crazy wondering what the other
    three were, they're:  `The Telltale Head (7G07),' `Episode 23: Bart
    Gets Hit by a Car (7F10),' and, `The Simpsons 138th Episode
    Spectacular (3F31).'"

Van Heflin
He is actor from "a bygone era".  Tom Baker provides a small biography
    from Halliwell's "Filmgoer's Companion":

    "Heflin, Van (1910-1971) (Emmett Evan Heflin).
    Purposeful American leading man of the forties, craggy character
    actor of the fifties and sixties."

Tom Baker adds that Heflin had a skinny and sharp nose.  "I see that
    his movies include `Santa Fe Trail' (with Ronald Reagan), `Green
    Dolphin Street', `Shane', `The Greatest Story Ever Told', and
    `Airport'."

Reviews

Dale Abersold - An instant classic!  Here's to Our Favorite Writers for
    giving us this wonderfully kinetic portrait of Our Favorite City.
    The great moments are too numerous to mention, but the Van Houtens
    in Herman's store, Lisa's new hairstyle, and Nelson's comeuppance
    were highlights.  Grade: A+.  Best of the season.

Erik Berliner - This was a hilarious episode.  For an episode really
    lacking plot, it held together reasonably well.  The Lisa sub-plot
    was okay, and the idea behind the story was good, but the Pulp
    Fiction references put this over the top.  The cops in the diner
    had my brother and I cracking up, and it only got better from
    there.  One of the best episodes of the season.  A+

James Cherry [we finally hear from my predecessor! --ed] - Brilliant.
    Just when I think they can't make an episode that outdoes the last
    brillian one (3F01), they do it.  Too many classic scenes to
    recount: Apu, Cletus, Skinner/Chalmers, Nelson, and the "Pulp
    Fiction" stuff -- I'm in awe.  Grade: A+.

Chris Courtois - "22 Short Films About Springfield" was probably the
    ultimate "wacky" episode. Just a bunch of short bits unhampered by
    plot or logic. As such, it's hard to evaluate the episode as a
    whole; it's more how one reacts to the individual parts. A few were
    quite funny (the Skinner/Superintendant sitcom; Nelson's
    comeuppance; Rev. Lovejoy's dog walk), most were so-so, a few
    seemed forced (Lisa's hair; the Pulp Fiction references, while
    amusing, existed solely for the purpose of being Pulp Fiction
    references), none were flat-out duds. One episode-wide item worthy
    of mention was the spectacular direction. The flow from story to
    story was smooth and clever.  A very interesting experiment. Like
    most sketch comedy shows, a rating is a matter of hits-to-miss
    ratio. Most of the bits were just so-so, but there were enough good
    ones to rate a B-.

Don Del Grande - C-plus - I was expecting fast-paced plotless comedy.
    What I got was the occasional chuckle in what almost makes the two
    clip shows look good.  After this episode, all I can say is "Dov'e
    mia tequila?"  (which is as close to Italian for "Donde esta mi
    tequila" as I can get without accents)

Jeff Gustafson - The writers of "The Simpsons" really outdid themselves
    with this episode.  Each scene flowed into the other quite well.
    I'd have to agree with a lot of people on this list that say the
    best part of this whole episode was the Skinner and Chalmer's part.
    A+

Jason Hancock - Well, I'll give the writers credit for trying a
    different approach to a Simpsons episode.  The only problem was
    that the "title" sequences were misleading, as they were not the
    basis for the whole act.  But we did get to see more of what
    Springfield was like.  And even though some parts (like the Nelson
    scene) were dumb, the episode was funny in other parts, especially
    Apu's party and the Bumblebee Man sequence.  Grade: B+.

Haynes Lee - I suspect this is a collection of outtakes from other
    episodes. The tall guy humiliating Nelson is a classic but the
    Skinner short was stretched way too long. The bar holdup scene was
    too short and they should have had Frink.  Grade: B-

Adam Lipkin - Well, a nice, leisurely, meandering day in the life of
    the various Springfieldianites.  Good to see.  The different
    segments were well integrated, and on the whole they were pretty
    good.  The Skinner-Chalmers dinner was my favorite. I don't think I
    liked the Pulp Fiction parody-- to my knowledge, Herman wouldn't do
    that. Nelson's comeuppance was unexpected and while not entirely
    undeserved, it was a bit extreme. Overall grade, B+.

Veronica Marquez - The Chespirito spoof was marred by hideous Spanish,
    but the others were very funny.  I give it an A-.  Now back to
    `Chespirito' :-)

John Murray - Another great episode, maybe the Simpsons is not going
    downhill, as some people seem to think.  This episode had a new and
    exciting format that provided a change that really helped this
    episode.  This combined with great lines, great gags, lotsa
    references, and a plot that doesn't get boring made for a great
    episode.  Grade: A+

Mark Richey - An interesting experiment.  Some of the segments were
    funny, some were less funny.  [...]  Overall average: B  However,
    I'm going to give it a B+ because I like the idea.

Benjamin Robinson - Slightly uneven, but if you don't like one sketch
    you can wait thirty seconds, and another will be right along.  The
    best of these stories is probably "Skinner and the Superintendent,"
    which skewers the "wacky" sitcom genre with aplomb.  Other
    highlights:  The Bee Guy's home life, which eerily parallels his
    work life; Lisa's bad hair day; Maggie's captivity in the newspaper
    box; and Nelson's comeuppance.  The Cletus story was also
    surprisingly good.  (A-)

Marcus Ronaldi - Great episode, very surreal with all of the great
    characters.  This is what I watch the Simpsons for. ****1/2

Rick Senger - One of the most up-and-down shows in it's seven year run.
    The Chalmers/Skinner segment was classic, as was Nelson's
    comeuppance by the tall geeky guy in glasses, Homer's Maggie
    Conundrum, Bumblebee Man's slapstick and Lisa's gum predicament.
    Weaker where Cleetus the Slack-Jawed Yokel and Apu in "The Jolly
    Bengali" and Riviera doing his thing in E.R.  Still, this one was
    jam-packed with jokes, references, camera angles, and good
    dialogue, so I have few complaints.  A-

Yours Truly - Very good episode.  I'm very upset that the Krusty and
    Ralph and Marge the Hostage stories didn't make it, but I liked
    most of the show (except Moe).  The Spanish was amusing because it
    was so terrible, and of course I enjoyed the Chalmers/Skinner
    portion.  I'd give it an A-.

AVERAGE GRADE: B+/A- (3.63)

   Apu: Listen, serving the customer is merriment enough for me.

        Thank you, come again.  You see?  Most enjoyable.
Sanjay: Oh, I guarantee a wingding of titanic proportions.  You will

Lisa asks Marge if she can recycle a beer can.  "Why not?", she says.
Lisa walks out to the front curb, and tosses the can in a recycling
bin.  Bart skateboards by, and, not seeing Lisa there, tosses his
used bubble gum in the vicinity of the bin.  The sticky mass lands in
Lisa's hair.  She tries to pull the gum out, but with little success.

 Lisa: Mom, someone threw gum in my hair.
Marge: Are you sure?  Maybe it's just shampoo.  That washes right out.
-- I doubt it, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

But it _is_ gum, and it's pulling Lisa's hair out.

Wait, if I remember my Heloise, the trick to getting out gum... is

     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"
          
But it won't budge.  So Marge adds some mayonnaise and tells Lisa to
go out and sit in the sun.  Sulky, Lisa concurs.  A lone bee flies
near Lisa's hair.  She waves it off.  The bee comes back with its
buddies, and they descend on Lisa's head.

As she runs screaming around the back yard, one bee breaks off from
the pack.  The camera shifts to a bee's-eye view.  It flies past
Skinner, Bart (still skateboarding), and the Bee Guy.  Finally, it
alights on Smithers, who is pedaling Burns around on a bicycle built
for two.

   Burns: [looking up from his magazine]  Smithers, what's the meaning
          of this slacking off?
Smithers: Uh, there's a bee in my eye, sir.
   Burns: And?
Smithers: I, I'm allergic to bee stings.  They cause me to, uh, die.
   Burns: But we're running out of forward momentum.
Smithers: Uh, perhaps you could pedal for just a little while, sir?
   Burns: Quite impossible.  I could try to bat him off if you like.
           [tries, feebly]
Smithers: Uh, really, that's o-- [the bee stings Smithers, who slumps
          over the handlebars]
   Burns: Holy cats, man!  We're starting to wobble.
Smithers: [heavily slurred]  Get ... me ... to ... a ... hospital ...
          you ... have ... to ... pedal.
   Burns: Oh, Tuttle's Sunday trousers.  Fear not, I'll get you to a
          hospital -- the only way I know how.
          Smithers, you infernal ninny, stick your left hoof on that
          flange, now!  Now, if you can get it through your bug-addled
          brain, jam that second mephitic clodhopper of yours on the

-- Burns and Smithers bikercise,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Burns and that "wretched shirkaday" Smithers arrive at the
hospital's entrance, where the two men collapse in a heap.  Two
orderlies spring out the door with a stretcher.  They pause to take
stock of the situation, then take Burns onto the stretcher and into
the hospital.  Dr. Nick Riviera walks by.

Smithers: [collapsed] Help... me.
 Riviera: Holy smokes, you need booze. [tosses him change]
-- Don't worry, he'll be back, 
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Dr. Nick throws some change to Smithers, and walks inside the
hospital, and finds his way into a boardroom.

Riviera: Hi, everybody!
  Board: [unenthused]  Hi, Dr. Nick.
-- At a malpractice board hearing,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Chairman: Dr. Nick, this malpractice committee has received a few
          complaints against you.  [reads from clipboard]  Of the 160
          gravest charges, the most troubling are performing major
          operations with a knife and fork from a seafood restaurant.
 Riviera: But I cleaned them with my napkin.
Chairman: Misuse of the cadavers.
 Riviera: I get here earlier when I drive in the carpool lane.
-- "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

An orderly barges in, and yells that there's a crazy man with a
scalpel in E/R demanding to see a quack.  It's up to Dr. Nick.

The "crazy man" turns out to be Abe Simpson, holding off the
emergency room crowd.  Dr. Riviera asks "where is the trouble", and
Abe gives him a full load of symptons, which describe "bonus eruptus"
which is a disorder where the skeleton tries to leap out the mouth
and escape the body.  Abe's only hope is "transdental electromicide".
Dr. Riviera asks for a golf cart motor with a 1000 volt capacimator,
but the two-second hesitation pushes him past schedule.  Nick
improvises by ripping the cords from an operating lamp and shocking
the sh-- hell out of Abe.  "Keep doing that every five seconds",
the "doctor" instructs.  The malpractice charges are dropped, and
Dr. Nick enthuses "Free nose jobs for everyone!" starting with
Jasper, who wants a Van Heflin.

Dr. Nick leads Jasper off while Abe continues to receive trans-
dermal electromicide.  The treatment causes lights to flicker all
over town, including Moe's Tavern.

   Moe: Say, Barn, uh, remember when I said I'd have to send away to
        NASA to calculate your bar tab?
Barney: Oh ho, oh yeah, you had a good laugh, Moe.
   Moe: The results came back today.  
-- At Moe's Tavern, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

   Moe: [reading a printout] You owe me seventy billion dollars.
Barney: Huh?
   Moe: No, wait, wait, wait, that's for the Voyager spacecraft.
-- Moe got NASA to calculate Barney's tab,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"
          
Barney's tab is fourteen billion dollars.

Snake bursts into the bar, and threatens to kill Barney if Moe
moves.  Apparently uncaring of his best customer, Moe leaps behind
an alcove in the wall behind three inches of bulletproof glass...
leaving Snake free to steal all the money from the register.  Moe
remains trapped within the alcove until air runs out.

[End of Act I.  Time: 7'33"]

Elsewhere in Springfield, Superintendent Chalmers walks up to the
door of a neatly-kept house.  Principal Skinner greets him there.
Chalmers just grunts as the two men go inside.  Skinner heads for
the kitchen, where he notices smoke billowing out from the stove.
The worst has happened -- the roast he has prepared is burnt.
Skinner, however, has an ace up his sleeve.  He plans to purchase
fast food from the Krusty Burger across the street and pass it as his
own cooking.  Skinner starts to climb out the window when Chalmers
suddenly comes into the kitchen.

Chalmers: Seymour!
 Skinner: Superintendent; I was just, uh, just stretching my calves on
          the windowsill.  Isometric exercise.  Care to join me?
Chalmers: Why is there smoke coming out of your oven, Seymour?
 Skinner: Uh, oh, that isn't smoke, it's steam.  Steam from the steamed
          clams we're having.  [rubs stomach] Mmm -- steamed clams.
-- Skinner and the Superintendent, 
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Either Chalmers is satisfied with this explanation, or decides not
to pursue the matter further.  In any case, he goes back to the
dining room.  Skinner jumps out the window and runs over to the
Krusty Burger after Chalmers leaves.

A few minutes later, Skinner makes an entrance the dining room
carrying a big platter of Krusty Burgers.

 Skinner: Superintendent, I hope you're ready for mouth-watering
          hamburgers.
Chalmers: I thought we were having steamed clams.
 Skinner: Oh, no, I said, "steamed hams."  That's what I call
          hamburgers.
Chalmers: You call hamburgers steamed hams.
 Skinner: Yes, it's a regional dialect.
Chalmers: Uh-huh.  What region?
 Skinner: Uh, upstate New York.
Chalmers: Really.  Well, I'm from Utica and I never heard anyone use
          the phrase, "steamed hams."
 Skinner: Oh, not in Utica, no; it's an Albany expression.
Chalmers: I see.
-- Skinner and the Superintendent,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Chalmers suspends his disbelief long enough to enjoy some of
Skinner's steamed hams.

Chalmers: You know, these hamburgers are quite similar to the ones the
          have at Krusty Burger.
 Skinner: [laughs]  Oh, no, patented Skinner Burgers.  Old family
          recipe.
Chalmers: For steamed hams.
 Skinner: Yes.
Chalmers: Yes, and you call them steamed hams despite the fact that
          they are obviously grilled.  [shows Skinner the grill marks]
 Skinner: Uh ... you know ... one thing I sh-- ... 'scuse me for one
          second.
Chalmers: Of course.
-- Skinner and the Superintendent,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Skinner retires to the kitchen for a second.  When he walks back
into the dining room, we can see that the entire kitchen is in
flames.

 Skinner: [faking a yawn] Well, that was wonderful.  Good time was had
          by all.  I'm pooped.
Chalmers: Yes, I guess I should be --
           [notes entire kitchen is on fire]
          Good Lord, what is happening in there?
 Skinner: Aurora Borealis?
Chalmers: Aurora Borealis?  At this time of year?  A this time of day?
          In this part of the country?  Localized entirely within your
          kitchen?
 Skinner: Yes.
Chalmers: May I see it?
 Skinner: Oh, erm... No.
-- Skinner and Superintendent,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Skinner escorts Chalmers back outside.

   Agnes: [offscreen]  Seymour!  The house is on fire!
 Skinner: No, mother.  It's just the Northern Lights.
Chalmers: Well, Seymour, you are an odd fellow, but I must say you
          steam a good ham.
           [Chalmers walks off.  He looks back at Skinner, who flashes
            him the "thumbs-up" sign]
   Agnes: Help!  Help!

     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

A fire engines rushes to the Skinners' rescue.  It rushes past
Homer, who is carrying Maggie, a bundle of groceries, and is holding
Santa's Little Helper's leash.  He notices a disturbing news story in
the "Springfield Shopper" kiosk -- Senator Helms (R-NC) is calling
for a tax on donuts.  (Mmmm ... taxable food item.)  Juggling the
baby, the groceries, and the dog, Homer pays for and gets his copy of
the paper.  ("Done, and done!")  He quickly realizes the mission
wasn't entirely successful -- somehow, Maggie got locked in the
kiosk!  He fishes in his pockets for another quarter, but the coins
are all stretched out because of his stop at the railroad tracks.
Rushing off to get change leaves Maggie overly upset, so Homer
stays and tries various techniques to save her, all unsuccessful,
until he stumbled on the solution.

Later, at the old Simpson place, we see Homer's clever solution.  He
unbolted the kiosk and carried it, Maggie and all, back to the baby's
crib.  There, they play a rousing game of peek-a-boo, with Maggie
using the paper as a screen, and babbles.  At a Krusty Burger,
Chief Wiggum also babbles as he enjoys a meat-flavored sandwich.

   Lou: You know, I went to the McDonald's in Shelbyville on Friday
        night --
Wiggum: [interrupting] The McWhat?
   Lou: Uh, the McDonald's.  I, I never heard of it either, but they
        have over 2,000 locations in this state alone.
 Eddie: Must've sprung up overnight.
-- Ignorance is bliss, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"
   
   Lou: You know, the funniest thing though; it's the little
        differences.
Wiggum: Example.
   Lou: Well, at McDonald's you can buy a Krusty Burger with cheese,
        right?  But they don't call it a Krusty Burger with cheese.
Wiggum: Get out!  Well, what do they call it?
   Lou: A Quarter Pounder with cheese.
Wiggum: Quarter Pounder with cheese?  Well, I can picture the cheese,
        but, uh, do they have Krusty partially gelatinated non-dairy
        gum-based beverages?
   Lou: Mm-hm.  They call 'em, "shakes."
 Eddie: Huh, shakes.  You don't know what you're gettin'.
-- Don't think you want to know,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Chief Wiggum wants to get some donuts, but finds himself stuck in
the booth.  Eddie and Lou deflate the booth and help Wiggum out.

As Wiggum leaves the Krusty Burger, Pedro the Bee Guy drives past.
The camera follows him home.  He kisses his wife and removes his
outfit.

Ay, que dia miserable a trabajo.
-- Pedro the Bumblebee Man, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Pedro's atrocities during the filming (or making) of the show include
getting attacked by a woodpecker, becoming electrically shocked with
spaghetti, and whacked with a giant baseball.

Pedro: Ah, tiempo para relaxar en paz y quieto.
        [opens a cabinet full of oranges which wallop his head]
       !Ay, naranjas en la cabeza!
        [flails about in his home until he finds himself stuck on
         a chandelier]
       !Ay, una candelabra precariosa!

         ceiling down with it]

The rest of the house crumbles.

Snake, on the lam from the bar heist, drives by.  He stops at an
intersection, and sees Wiggum cross in front of him, who
(surprisingly) recognizes him.  Fearing the jig is up, Snake floors
the accelerator.  Wiggum tumbles over the hood and roof of the car.
Snake hits a mailbox (sending a gusher of mail skyward) before ramming
 wall.

Hey, hey, wait up!  We gotta swap insurance info!
-- Chief Wiggum after a car crash,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Wiggum catches up with Snake, and the two men fight.  They barrel-
roll right into Herman's military antique store.  Herman greets the
two combatants with his shotgun, and holds them up.

A donut rolls out of Wiggum's box, out the door, and down the sewer.
The camera tracks it back to Evergreen Terrace, where Reverend
Lovejoy is walking a sheepdog.  He stops in front of Flanders' house.

Lovejoy: C'mon boy, this is the spot, right here.  That's a good boy,
         do your dirty sinful business.
    Ned: Well, howdy, Reverend Lovejoy.  Nice to see you there ... on
         my lawn ... with your dog.
Lovejoy: Oh, oh, ooh, bad dog!  Look at that, right on Ned's lawn.
         Now how could you do such a thing?

       Marge Simpson!  Still making juice the old-fashioned way?
        [actually, Marge is squeezing it on Lisa's hair]
 Lisa: No, I've got gum in my hair.
Marge: Oh, we've tried everything:  olive oil, lemon juice, tartar
       sauce, chocolate syrup, gravy, bacon fat, hummus and baba
       ganoush.
 Lisa: My scalp hurts from horsefly bites.
  Ned: Why don't you freeze it with an ice cube, and hit it with a
       hammer?  Works for me when I get bubbly-gum in the old push-
       broom.
-- The Eternal Question of Gum in One's Hair,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Later, Ned bangs away at Lisa's hair on the kitchen table.
Unfortunately, all this does is flatten the gum out, mashing more
hair into the gum.  Everyone in town seems to want to take a bash at
solving this precarious problem, including Groundskeeper Willie,
Lionel Hutz, and the Capital City Goofball.

[End of Act II.  Time: 16'22"]

Time for another show-within-a-show, this time featuring our
favorite bumpkin.

Hey, what's going on on this side?
-- Cletus pokes his head through a TV cue card,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Brandine is doing some of her daily chores.  Cletus walks in,
carrying a pair of black shoes.

  Cletus: Hey, Brandine!  You might could wear these to your job
          interview.
Brandine: And scuff up the topless dancin' runway?  Naw, you best bring
          'em back from where you got 'em.
-- Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Cletus shimmies up a telephone pole, and tosses the shoes out on the
wire.

         [on top of a telephone pole]
Cletus: Hey you know what?  I could call my ma while I'm up here.
        [yelling] Hey, maw!  Get off the dang roof!
-- Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel,
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

The camera follows the phone wire back into The Android's Dungeon.
There, the owner is sending out for food.  Just when he completes
his order, Milhouse walks in with a potty emergency.  ("I'm gonna
explode!")  He must purchase something to use the bathroom, so
Milhouse gets with his three quarters a Hamburglar Adventure.
Milhouse pays for the comic.  Just then, his dad comes into the
store.  Mr. Van Houten returns for his kid and finds him buying
comic books.  Milhouse is dragged away.

Meanwhile at Herman's Military Antiques Shop, Herman has restrained
Chief Wiggum and Snake in bondage gear, and discusses their near
future.  "As soon as Zed gets here, the party will begin."  The door
buzzes, but it's not Zed, just those wacky Van Houtens.  Milhouse
still needs to use the bathroom, so Herman tells him to make it
quick.  Over Chief Wiggum and Snake's muffled protests, Mr. VH
reminisces about how the store used to be a pet shop.  But Herman
will have none of it.  "Get in the corner," he orders.  But soon
afterward, he's whacked on the head with a mace... the ball-and-
chain kind.  He's also wearing a helmet.  Milhouse wants to buy
this ensemble, then notices Herman unconscious on the floor.

Wiggum uses the moment to hop out on his chair.  Outside, he crosses
paths with Lisa.  She steps in the Snippy Longstocking barbershop,
and gets into the chair.  She gets her gummy hair cut into a nice-
looking style.

I finally look like a real person!
-- Lisa, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield" (meta-humor alert)

Nelson does appreciate Lisa's new look -- he laughs at her ("HA-
ha!").  Lisa sighs and replaces her wool hat.  Mrs. Glick walks by,
trips on the curb, and winds up head-first in a trash can.  Nelson
laughs at this, too.  An extremely tall man drives past in a VW
Beetle, scrunched up so his knees almost bang into his head.  Nelson
laughs.  This proves to be his undoing.  The man pulls over, unfolds
himself from the car, and pursues Nelson.  Realizing his predicament
("Crud.") Nelson runs off.  The man rounds the corner, but sees only
Lisa, and an open manhole.  Of course, the manhole is where Nelson
is hiding.

Wadlow: [lifts Nelson out of the sewer by his head]
         Do you find something comical about my appearance when I'm
         driving my automobile?
Nelson: Yeah.
Wadlow: Everyone needs to drive a vehicle, even the very tall.
         [turns Nelson to face the car] 
        This was the largest auto that I could afford.  Am I therefore
        to be made the subject of fun?
Nelson: I guess so.
-- Nelson, unclear on the concept, 
     "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

The tall guy forces Nelson to march down Main Street, pants down.  
He drives slowly behind the ashamed bully.

Wadlow: Hey, everybody!  Look at this -- it's that boy who laughs at
        everyone.  [Nelson]  Let's laugh at him!
 Crowd: HA-ha!
-- Stupid poetic justice, "Twenty-Two Short Films About Springfield"

Ketchup and mustard rain down on Nelson.  From the bridge, Bart and
Milhouse laugh at him.  Bart still remembers his comment from about
21 minutes and 10 seconds ago, and Milhouse agrees.  "Everybody in
town's got their story to tell."  Bart notes, "There's just not
enough time to hear them all."

As if on cue, Professor John Frink tries to get in a funny story
of his own... but he's too late.  The camera fades out on the poor
professor, even as he tries to sing his monkey-written theme song.
